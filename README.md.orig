# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
GAS_REPORT=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

# polygon-defidapp
This is a robust defidapp built on the Polygon(Mumbai) blockchain. It uses hardhat and nomadfoundation as well as the popular Openzeppellin dependency to demonstrate one of the important pillars of web3 technologies. The dapp would be able to sell and purchase the native currency, OBToken from the user. The frontend is built with Nextjs, a formidable iteration from Reactjs.
